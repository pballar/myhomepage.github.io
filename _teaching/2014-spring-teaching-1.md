The course aims at providing engineering students with an overview to problem of soft- ware design by means of the object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. Apart from introducing the basic elements of OOP (i.e. notion of class/object, computation by mes- sage passing, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, etc), a particular emphasis is given to aspects such as code flexibility/extensibility. On completing the course the student is ex- pected to have developed sufficient skills to develop standard OOP solutions starting from a set of specifications/requirements. The student is also expected to be able to consider software quality aspects while designing a software solution, thus, for example, being ca- pable of distinguishing between design choices that result in more flexible solutions from those that result in a code whose extension is very costly (i.e. violation of the open-close principle). The course is carefully structured so that each notion introduced during a lecture is followed by a practical work (i.e. coding) which requires its application. In terms of code development the students will learn the Java language and will learn the Java development process under the Eclipse IDE. Furthermore students will learn some basic notions of UML modelling and in particular will develop UML class diagrams under Eclipse by means of the Papyrus modelling framework. Similarly students will apprehend the notions of code testing and its systematic application as an integral part of the software development process (Test Driven Development).
