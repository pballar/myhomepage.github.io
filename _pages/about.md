I am a Maître des Conferences HDR of Computer Science at the [Ecole CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/)  of the [University  Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/).  

## Short bio
I obtained a  MSc (1999) and a PhD (2004) in Computer Science at University of Torino. I then served as postdoc researcher in computer science at different institutions including, the University of Liverpool (2004-2005),  the University of Glasgow (2006-2007), the Microsoft  research centre for Computational Systems Biology (CoSBi, in Trento), the University of Paris-Est Créteil. Since September 2011 I hold an assistant professor position at Ecole Centrale Paris. In 2023 I obtained the [Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04335487) 

## Research interests 
My principle research interests are in the area of formal methods for modelling and verification of  systems characterised by stochasticity,  concurrency and parallelism
