I am a Maître des Conferences HDR in Computer Science at the laboratory for [Mathematics and Informatics for Complex Systems (MICS)](https://www.mics.centralesupelec.fr/) of the [Ecole CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/)  a school of engineering which is part of the [University  Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/). 

My principle research interests are in the area of formal methods for modelling and verification of  systems characterised by stochasticity,  concurrency and parallelism. 

I am involved in teaching computer science related courses in all 3 years of the CentraleSupélec engineering curriculum, as well as, at MSc level (master in [Data Science and Business Administration](https://www.essec.edu/en/program/master-data-sciences-business-analytics/)) 

## Short bio
I obtained a  MSc (1999) and a PhD (2004) in Computer Science at University of Torino. I then served as postdoc researcher in computer science at different institutions including, the University of Liverpool (2004-2005),  the University of Glasgow (2006-2007), the Microsoft  research centre for Computational Systems Biology (CoSBi, in Trento), the University of Paris-Est Créteil. Since September 2011 I hold a Maître des Conferences (Lecturer)  position at Ecole CentraleSupélec (formerly Ecole Centrale Paris). In 2023 I obtained the **Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches** with a memoire on [Contributions to formal modelling and analysis of stochastic models ](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04335487)
